# Core Technologies

- Kubernetes/Minikube
  - Local cluster for running all components.
  - NGINX Ingress addon for host-based routing and TLS termination.
- Helm
  - Charts under `helm/` deploy emulator, provider, API, UI, ingress, and verification job.
  - Values in [`helm/values.yaml`](../helm/values.yaml) and generated `overrides.yaml` control behavior.
- Azure App Configuration
  - Emulator container for local testing.
  - Kubernetes Provider (CRD kind: [`AzureAppConfigurationProvider`](../helm/templates/provider/provider.yaml)) syncs settings and feature flags to a ConfigMap.
- TLS & Certificates
  - Self-signed certs generated by [`deploy.sh`](../deploy.sh) (SANs for *.demo.local, demo.local, 127.0.0.1).
  - Certs stored as Kubernetes Secret and also trusted on Linux host via update-ca-certificates.
- Python/Flask API
  - Flask + Flask-RESTX + CORS, reads configuration JSON mounted at `/app/settings.json`.
  - Uses pandas to query CSV data mounted at `/app/data`.
- Next.js UI
  - SSR reads server-side config from `/app/settings.json` via `lib/serverConfigService.js`.
  - Client uses Axios configured with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`.
- Data & Verification
  - Dataset CSVs in `data/` mounted to API pod.
  - Post-install Job ([`verification/job.yaml`](../helm/templates/verification/job.yaml)) verifies mount presence, size, readability.
